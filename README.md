### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Principal Scientist with [Adobe Systems](https://www.adobe.com) where I serve as their PDF Architect having been involved with PDF technology for more than 20 years. 

In 2019, I took on the responsibility for architecture of their Content Authenticity Initiative, serving as its Chief Architect. This lead me to help start the [C2PA](https://c2pa.org), which has created the industry's first open standard for content provenance and authenticity. I continue to lead their Technical Working Group.

Another of my roles at Adobe is as their Senior Standards Representative. I represent Adobe on various international standards bodies including the ISO, W3C, ICC and more including being the the first American in [ETSI/ESI](https://www.etsi.org/technologies/digital-signature) (the European Standards body).  In addition to my work on PDF and C2PA, some other standards that I am currently involved with include updates to JPEG and PNG.
